ðŸ’» The Web Starts Here: HTML & CSS Basics

Posted by TechCartelHQ â€” Tuesday, July 22nd, 2027

Every website youâ€™ve ever seen is built on three main technologies:  
HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for functionality.

In this session, weâ€™re starting with **HTML and CSS â€” the building blocks of the web.**

ðŸ–‹ What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.  
Itâ€™s how we structure and organize everything you see on a web page.  
You use it to tell the browser whatâ€™s what â€” paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.  

Some examples of what you can create with HTML:  
- Regular paragraphs of text  
- Bold or italic text for emphasis  
- Unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists  
- Assign classes to elements for styling later

HTML is not a programming language â€” itâ€™s a **markup language** that describes your content.

ðŸŽ¨ What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  
If HTML is the skeleton of a web page, CSS is the skin, clothing, and vibe.  
It lets you style and position your HTML however you want.  

With CSS, you can:  
- Change colors, fonts, and text sizes  
- Create layouts with spacing, grids, or flexbox  
- Add hover effects and animations  
- Make your page responsive for all screen sizes

You write rules in CSS that select HTML elements and apply styles to them.  
It works alongside HTML â€” you canâ€™t style what isnâ€™t structured.

ðŸ§  Why are HTML and CSS so important?

Mastering these two gives you the power to:  
- Build clean, accessible web pages  
- Handcraft designs without relying on templates  
- Impress users (and clients) with professional layouts  
- Have full creative control over your site

Stay focused and keep it clean â€” the web is yours to design.
