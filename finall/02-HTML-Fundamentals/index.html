    <h2>ðŸ’» The Web Starts Here: HTML & CSS Basics</h2>
    <p>Posted by TechCartelHQ â€” Tuesday, July 22nd, 2027</p>

    <p>
      Every website youâ€™ve ever seen is built on three main technologies: HTML
      for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this session, weâ€™re starting with **HTML and CSS â€” the building blocks
      of the web.

    <h2>ðŸ–‹ What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Itâ€™s how we structure and
      organize everything you see on a web page. You use it to tell the browser
      whatâ€™s what â€” paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.
    </p>

    <p>Some examples of what you can create with HTML:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Regular paragraphs of text</li>
      <li>Bold or italic text for emphasis</li>
      <li>Unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists</li>
      <li>Assign classes to elements for styling later</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      HTML is not a programming language â€” itâ€™s a **markup language** that
      describes your content.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸŽ¨ What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. If HTML is the skeleton of a web
      page, CSS is the skin, clothing, and vibe. It lets you style and position
      your HTML however you want.
    </p>

    <p>With CSS, you can &rarr;:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change colors, fonts, and text sizes</li>
      <li>Create layouts with spacing, grids, or flexbox</li>
      <li>Add hover effects and animations</li>
      <li>Make your page responsive for all screen sizes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You write rules in CSS that select HTML elements and apply styles to them.
      It works alongside HTML â€” you canâ€™t style what isnâ€™t structured.
